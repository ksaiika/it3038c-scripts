Here's how to run the following scripts using the Python plug-in Pillow. We will be converting a jpg into ppm, merging two images together and placing a kaleidoscope effect on an image.

To start, lets install any necessary packages:
1. Open your linux machine and open your terminal
2. Type in: python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
3. You should be ready to start!


To run the scripts included in this folder:
1. Save two imagess you'd like to work with
2. Navigate to the folder you have your images/scripts in
3. Type vim whichever-effect.py > type 'i' to insert data ** whichever effect should either be conversion.py, merge.py, kaleidoscope.py
4. Replace the image names in the script with the image names you've saved > hit esc then type ':wq' to exit out of vim
5. Type 'Python whichever-effect.py' and that should apply the effect and show the result.
