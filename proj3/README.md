Welcome to username / password generator!

This generator takes out the difficulty of having to create your own username and password. You enter a relevant keyword for your username and it will include that in the name and the password will generate randomly.
It will then export to your desktop once the script is finished running and from there you can rename, move, hide, do as you please with the file.

Here are the steps to run the username / password generator: 


1. Open your linux box

2. Save the p3.py file to a specific file or location within your linux machine

3. Open terminal and navigate to where the file is using linux terminal commands (ls, cd, mv - here is a link to these commands if you are unfamiliar: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands)

4. Type in python p3.py to begin the program

5. It will prompt you to enter a username length - input a number and hit enter

6. It will prompt you to enter a keyword to use with your username, keep in mind this takes into account the length you input. Hit enter after you're done.

7. Enter characters/numbers/symbols you would like to exclude from username, separated by commas then hit enter. If none, hit enter.

8. It will ask if you want to include characters, numbers and symbols. Enter y or n and hit enter for each inquiry.

9. The same questions for steps 5 and 7 will appear for the password. Type your response accordingly and hit enter.

10. Once completed, you will receive a message that the username and password were generated and exported to your desktop with the full file path.

11. PLEASE NOTE: you can generate multiple combinations, each one will be saved to your desktop with a file name along the lines of upass1.txt, upass2.txt, and so on.

12. Store this somewhere safe, encrypt it, modify it as needed or re-run to get different results.


Thanks for using the username and password generator!! :)
